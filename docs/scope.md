# GlyphOS Kernel v1.0 - Scope

## What's In Scope

### Core Kernel (v1.0)
- **MJLOG coupling matrix** - Mathematical definition and implementation
- **Physical binding layer** - Nodes anchored to spacetime coordinates with retarded-time phase
- **π–φ–432 framework** - Golden Pi, bridge frequency, harmonic ladder computations
- **Anchor frequencies** - 432 Hz and 838.776 Hz as canonical constants
- **Gate validation tiers** - 11/22/33/44 Hz as input validation and readiness checks
- **Phase utilities** - Direct and retarded-time phase calculations
- **Validation harness** - Gradient scaling, minor statistics, statistical controls

### Documentation (v1.0)
- Mathematical specifications
- API reference
- Installation and usage guides
- Test suite documentation
- Ontological status for academic review

## What's Out of Scope (Future Research)

### Interpretive Frameworks
- Consciousness-physics mapping proposals
- Metaphysical interpretations
- Ontological commitments beyond mathematical predictions
- Philosophical implications

**Status:** Speculative - require separate theoretical development

### Application Domains
Potential applications of the framework to specific physical systems are considered future work and require domain-specific empirical validation. No application-level claims are made in v1.0.

### Engineering Applications (Not Validated)
- Specific device implementations
- Performance specifications for technologies
- Commercial product development
- Energy system applications
- Propulsion or field-effect technologies

**Status:** Requires engineering validation, safety testing, and regulatory approval

### Historical and Cultural Studies
- Archaeological interpretations
- Historical priority claims
- Cultural context research

**Status:** Contextual observations - not part of mathematical validation

## Design Philosophy

**v1.0 is intentionally minimal:**
- Provides mathematical kernel and validation framework
- Makes falsifiable predictions without requiring specific interpretation
- Ontology-agnostic - works under any physical interpretation
- Clean separation between kernel (mathematically proven) and applications (empirically testable)

**Extensions are modular:**
- Applications build ON the kernel, not IN it
- Each extension can be validated independently
- Kernel remains stable while extensions evolve
- Semantic versioning ensures compatibility

**Academic integrity:**
- Core claims limited to what's mathematically demonstrable
- Empirical claims clearly marked as hypotheses
- Falsification protocols provided for all testable predictions
- No performance guarantees for unvalidated applications

## Validation Requirements for Extensions

Any application claiming to use GlyphOS Kernel must provide:

1. **Clear hypothesis** - What specific prediction is being tested?
2. **Empirical data** - Actual measurements from target system
3. **Control comparisons** - Performance vs. null models
4. **Fatal controls** - Tests that would falsify the hypothesis
5. **Statistical analysis** - Quantified effect sizes with confidence intervals
6. **Independent replication** - Results reproducible by other researchers

**Without these, applications remain speculative.**

## Version Policy

- **v1.0.x** - Bug fixes only, no semantic changes
- **v1.1+** - New features, backward compatible extensions
- **v2.0+** - Breaking changes (if ever needed)

The kernel semantics are immutable once tagged. This ensures:
- Reproducible research
- Stable foundation for applications
- Clear provenance for derived work
- Academic citation integrity

## Relationship to Other Work

### What This Framework Is
- A **computational physics framework** for modeling harmonic systems
- A **mathematical structure** with falsifiable predictions
- A **research tool** for exploring π–φ geometric relationships

### What This Framework Is NOT
- A replacement for established physics (QM, GR, thermodynamics)
- A proven theory of consciousness or metaphysics
- A validated engineering solution for any specific technology
- An archaeological discovery or historical priority claim

## Future Development Roadmap

### Near-term (v1.1-1.5)
- Extended validation metrics
- Additional geometric relationships (beyond π–φ–432)
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced visualization tools

### Medium-term (v2.0+)
- Multi-scale coupling extensions
- Nonlinear dynamics integration
- Machine learning interfaces
- Cross-platform implementations

### Long-term (Separate Projects)
- Domain-specific applications (biology, acoustics, etc.)
- Engineering implementations
- Experimental validation partnerships
- Peer-reviewed publications

## Boundary Enforcement

To maintain academic integrity, **v1.0 core will NOT include:**

❌ Claims about fundamental physics not backed by the mathematics  
❌ Device specifications or engineering blueprints  
❌ Medical claims without clinical validation  
❌ Financial or economic applications  
❌ Metaphysical or consciousness frameworks without clear mechanism  
❌ Historical or archaeological interpretations  
❌ Performance guarantees for any application  

**These belong in separate work with appropriate validation.**

**Summary:** GlyphOS Kernel v1.0 is a focused mathematical and computational framework. Applications, interpretations, and engineering implementations are explicitly out of scope and require independent validation.
