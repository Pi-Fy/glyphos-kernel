# GlyphOS Kernel v1.0 - Scope

## What's In Scope

### Core Kernel (v1.0)
- **MJLOG coupling matrix** - Mathematical definition and implementation
- **Physical binding layer** - Nodes anchored to spacetime coordinates with retarded-time phase
- **π–φ–432 framework** - Golden Pi, bridge frequency, harmonic ladder computations
- **Anchor frequencies** - 432 Hz and 838.776 Hz as canonical constants
- **Gate validation tiers** - 11/22/33/44 as input sanity and readiness checks
- **Phase utilities** - Direct and retarded-time phase calculations
- **Validation harness** - Gradient scaling, minor statistics, statistical controls

### Documentation (v1.0)
- Mathematical specifications
- API reference
- Installation and usage guides
- Test suite documentation

## What's Out of Scope (Future Modules)

### Interpretive Frameworks
- Quantum consciousness mappings
- Metaphysical overlays
- Consciousness-physics interfaces
- Ontological commitments beyond mathematical predictions

### Application Layers
- Zero-point energy (ZPE) extraction systems
- Electrogravitic propulsion blueprints
- Medical/biological/DNA applications
- Quantum financial systems (QFS)
- Gate33 full diagnostic system (operator integrity validation)

### Experimental Claims
- Specific device implementations
- Performance guarantees for applications
- Bloom Grid validation results (framework ready, results pending)

## Design Philosophy

**v1.0 is intentionally minimal:**
- Provides mathematical kernel and validation framework
- Makes falsifiable predictions without interpretation
- Ontology-agnostic - works under any physical interpretation
- Clean separation between kernel (proven) and applications (exploratory)

**Extensions are modular:**
- Applications build ON the kernel, not IN it
- Each extension can be validated independently
- Kernel remains stable while extensions evolve
- Semantic versioning ensures compatibility

## Version Policy

- **v1.0.x** - Bug fixes only, no semantic changes
- **v1.1+** - New features, backward compatible extensions
- **v2.0+** - Breaking changes (if ever needed)

The kernel semantics are immutable once tagged. This ensures:
- Reproducible research
- Stable foundation for applications
- Clear provenance for derived work
